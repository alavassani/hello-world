# hello-world
This is the first test repository I create at GitHub but it won't be the last.
I have lot of ideas, but I'm tired relying on others to develop some code for me. From now on, I'll be doing it myself, but I will still need the help of the community, of you guys on GitHub.
So, let's start this journey together!
